1
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:11,571
I've always loved getting clean.

2
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:14,449
I love baths.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,661
I love showers.

4
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:26,169
It's my happy place.

5
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,427
Was my happy place.

6
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:45,689
All inmates in D dorm
must be checked for lice.

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,484
Repeat, all inmates in D
dorm must be checked for lice.

8
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:54,947
Oh, I'll be out in a sec. I swear.

9
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:59,202
I'll wait. There best
be some hot water left.

10
00:00:59,369 --> 01:00:01,538
There wasn't very much when I started.

11
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,208
Man, hurry!

12
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,211
All right, okay, okay.

13
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,380
I'm done. I'm out. I'm totally out.

14
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,340
Damn, you got some nice titties.

15
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,926
- Thank you.
- You got them TV titties.

16
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:19,263
They stand up on they own
all perky and everything.

17
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:20,931
Okay.

18
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,103
You know they sell
flip-flops at the commissary.

19
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:28,398
My money's not in yet, so.

20
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:32,109
You creative. I give you that, high-tits.

21
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:35,572
Now get the fuck out the way.

22
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:36,947
Okay.

23
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,055
So, there's an entire pig in there?

24
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:13,306
Yes.

25
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:14,849
For four of us?

26
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:18,437
It's a small pig. I really
wanted to use the box.

27
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:20,021
It was my birthday present.

28
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:22,274
She's guilty she's leaving.

29
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,775
It's a guilt pig-roasting box.

30
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,651
At least you get something.

31
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:28,488
I'm not getting laid for a
year, too, but what do I get?

32
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,115
A baby?

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,533
But you can't eat it.

34
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,288
- Are we really gonna eat that?
- It's thematic.

35
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,039
You're not serving time in Cuba.

36
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:39,749
Pigs. Cops.

37
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:46,256
How the fuck are you
going to jail tomorrow?

38
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:48,758
Prison, not jail.

39
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,470
You're missing my shower.

40
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,846
Polly, I'm really sorry.

41
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:56,516
I know.

42
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:02,647
You focus on how you're gonna
maintain your eyebrows behind bars.

43
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:05,983
You may not come back with a unibrow.

44
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:09,321
Am I allowed to cry?

45
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:11,990
No. Seriously, no.

46
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,287
Okay, we are ready. Everybody inside.

47
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:18,913
- Need a hoist?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,582
Big girl.

49
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,708
On to the last supper.

50
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,797
- We got to do it.
- I know.

51
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:31,134
God, we really should
not have eaten so much.

52
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:33,637
I know. Come on, we gotta rally.

53
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:34,887
Okay.

54
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:38,183
- Make some memories, you know?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,019
You need spank-bank material.

56
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,105
Oh, well, I mean, when
you say it like that.

57
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,994
- Wait, I got...
- What?

58
00:04:58,077 --> 01:04:00,205
- I gotta pee.
- What? No.

59
01:04:00,288 --> 01:04:01,331
- Yeah.
- Really?

60
01:04:01,414 --> 00:05:03,542
I just...

61
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:06,961
I'll be... I'll be right back.

62
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,175
Hey.

63
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,010
Yeah?

64
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:16,513
You look beautiful.

65
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:20,141
Thanks.

66
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:34,573
Oh, shit.

67
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:35,799
What?

68
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,640
You look beautiful, too.

69
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,355
Come on. Get in.

70
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,253
Hey. You're crying.

71
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:16,007
Just fuck me.

72
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,342
Piper.

73
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:19,093
Shut up.

74
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:22,388
Please. Please.

75
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,685
Okay.

76
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:07,975
No visiting today.

77
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:11,396
Hi, um, I'm here to surrender.

78
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:13,064
Oh, okay, then.

79
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:19,070
Did he look surprised to you?

80
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,781
When I said that I was here to
surrender? Didn't he look surprised?

81
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:23,658
Like, "What the hell is she doing here?"

82
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,412
- I didn't notice.
- Well, he looked surprised to me.

83
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,210
I look like shit. My eyes are all puffy.

84
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:35,378
You're worried about how you look?

85
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,588
Well, they're gonna know that I was crying.

86
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,339
It's a sign of weakness.
You can't show any weakness.

87
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:39,799
That's what all of the books said.

88
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:41,008
Oh, sweetie...

89
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:42,927
Don't call me sweetie.

90
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,429
Oh, Leonard.

91
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,098
That's better.

92
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,231
I can't take it with me.

93
00:08:58,568 --> 01:08:00,570
Oh, okay. Right.

94
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:04,908
What are you doing?

95
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,033
What?

96
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,493
You can't put that in your pocket.

97
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,537
It's gonna end up at the
bottom of the washing machine.

98
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:11,289
Okay. Um...

99
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:12,749
Where would you like me
to put it then, Piper?

100
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:14,292
Up your ass.

101
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,629
There's no room. Apparently,
my head's already up there.

102
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:19,881
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:24,051
It's okay.

104
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,556
You know what?

105
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,060
I'm gonna put it in my wallet. Okay?

106
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:37,482
And when I get home, I will
put it in your jewelry box.

107
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:40,234
Until I'm short on
rent, then I may hock it.

108
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:43,738
But I'll try to get it
back before you're out.

109
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,245
We should go.

110
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,997
Okay.

111
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,836
Okay.

112
00:09:59,128 --> 01:09:00,338
Self-surrender.

113
01:09:00,463 --> 01:09:02,214
Yeah, well, no one told me either.

114
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,633
Available guards...

115
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,593
Got the paperwork right here.

116
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,679
Name is Chapman.

117
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:13,852
Yeah. Chap, like when your lips
get all dry they're chapped.

118
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,144
Have a seat.

119
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:20,608
Piper. Rhymes with sniper.

120
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:23,402
Inmate Robinson to the visitor area.

121
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:28,491
You hungry?

122
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:29,742
Not really.

123
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:31,536
Guard Thomson to the tower.

124
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:32,787
Eat anyway.

125
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:34,831
It's burrata.

126
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,542
Thank you.

127
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:46,050
My mother told her friends I'm
doing volunteer work in Africa.

128
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:51,389
I bet they're all appalled that you've
gone somewhere so filthy and dangerous.

129
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:58,980
So I never carried drugs. Just money.

130
00:10:59,856 --> 01:10:01,232
You were a lesbian?

131
01:10:01,900 --> 00:11:03,359
At the time.

132
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:05,403
You still a lesbian?

133
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,446
No, I'm not still a lesbian.

134
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,907
You sure?

135
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:14,537
I once kissed Mary Straley when
I was at Miss Porter's school.

136
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,914
But it wasn't for me.

137
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:17,289
Wow.

138
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,250
Did you know about all this?

139
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,754
No. No, no, I didn't.

140
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:27,341
I mean, she told me how
she traveled after college,

141
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,594
but she failed to mention the lesbian lover

142
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,554
who ran an international
drug smuggling ring.

143
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:33,305
Imagine my surprise.

144
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,434
What on earth did you do with the money?

145
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,437
Well, Grandmother, I wasn't
really in it for the money.

146
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,732
Oh, Piper, for heaven's sake!

147
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,948
So this is my last post as a free woman.

148
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:52,408
- What are you gonna write?
- Hey!

149
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,744
Oh, no. You cannot have a phone in here.

150
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:56,788
This is a federal facility.
You have to take that out.

151
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:59,206
Oh, can I? Am I allowed to go out?

152
00:11:59,290 --> 01:11:00,332
He can take it out.

153
01:11:00,458 --> 00:12:02,835
So no phone?

154
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,503
- You knew that.
- Now.

155
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:06,464
Oh, my God, Larry, by the time I get out

156
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,925
there'll have been, like, three
new generations of iPhones.

157
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,803
Sir, I can get an
officer to escort you out.

158
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:15,556
No, I'm going. It's okay, I'm going,
okay? I'll be right back, okay?

159
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,684
I'll take the phone to the
car, I'll be right back.

160
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,019
Okay? Two seconds.

161
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:21,562
- Yeah?
- Okay.

162
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:24,523
Two seconds.

163
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:28,987
- Chapman!
- Yes.

164
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:33,324
Yes, that's me. But you have to wait.

165
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,659
You're telling me what I have to do?

166
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,662
Get your ass over here,
Chapman, now. Move it.

167
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:38,871
He's, he's gonna be right back.

168
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:40,163
We've been waiting here for two hours.

169
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:41,624
And the wait is over.

170
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,166
Here's your temporary ID,

171
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,795
you'll stick this on your uniform
when we get to that. Now...

172
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,839
- Here. I'm here. Here I am.
- Here he is.

173
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:50,133
- Who's this?
- My fiancé.

174
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,467
Yeah? Good luck with that.

175
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,677
Excuse me?

176
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,512
- Any personal items?
- Here.

177
00:12:58,265 --> 00:12:59,475
You can't take this check.

178
00:12:59,558 --> 01:12:01,727
But we called last week.
And they told me to bring it.

179
01:12:01,853 --> 00:13:03,021
He has to send it to Iowa.

180
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,522
It takes a few weeks to process.

181
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:07,150
A few weeks? Doesn't
she need to buy things?

182
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:08,317
How it is.

183
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,820
Where do we send it?

184
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,698
Hey, you got that Iowa address?

185
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:17,702
Any Nudie Judies in here?
Skin pics? Naughty stuff?

186
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:20,080
No. No Nudie Judies.

187
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,332
Time to say goodbye. It might be
a while till you can visit, fiancé.

188
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:27,210
I love you so much.

189
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:28,337
I love you, too!

190
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,506
- I'll call you as soon as I can.
- Okay.

191
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:32,758
Okay? Please send that check immediately.

192
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:34,217
Okay. I will.

193
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,554
I love you. Please keep my website updated.

194
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,722
I love you so much.

195
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,224
It's okay.

196
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,235
It's okay.

197
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:06,417
- What size shoe are you?
- Nine and a half, ten.

198
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,758
These are kinda like Toms.

199
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:16,594
- Who's Tom?
- Toms are shoes.

200
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,847
When you buy a pair, the company
gives another to a child in need.

201
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,391
They're great. And they come in
lots of different colors and...

202
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:23,768
How nice.

203
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,771
Strip.

204
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:50,461
Get over here.

205
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,767
Come here.

206
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,573
Are you gonna miss me?

207
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:21,826
Yes.

208
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:25,955
Too much.

209
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,542
Come with me.

210
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:32,544
What?

211
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:34,922
Come to Bali.

212
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:38,550
Come with me. I mean it.
I'll buy you a plane ticket.

213
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,681
Are you serious?

214
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,434
Yes.

215
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:55,234
Come with me. Quit your job. Come with me.

216
00:15:56,194 --> 01:15:00,489
Well, I'd have to give notice.

217
01:15:00,572 --> 00:16:03,034
You're a fucking waitress. You
don't need to give a notice.

218
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,786
Will I get in trouble?

219
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,954
God, I hope so.

220
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,711
You know what I mean.

221
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,671
You don't have to do anything.

222
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:19,967
You're just there to keep
me company, all right?

223
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,181
Come on, babe. I want you to come.

224
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,099
And I want you to come.

225
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:32,897
Yes? Is that a yes?

226
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,232
Yes.

227
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,193
Yes.

228
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:39,111
Open your mouth, stick out your tongue.

229
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:41,488
Inmates, an updated facility rules with

230
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:43,407
inmate discipline list
is posted in the day room.

231
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:46,702
Lift up your arms.

232
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:50,915
Turn around.

233
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:55,711
Squat.

234
00:16:59,048 --> 01:16:00,674
Spread your cheeks and cough.

235
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:04,262
Seriously?

236
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:18,401
That it?

237
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,152
One more coming, hold on.

238
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:26,825
My zipper's broken.

239
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,788
First time down?

240
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:32,123
My first time here?

241
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:34,833
Oh, no, your first time in prison?

242
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,253
Oh, yeah.

243
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:40,256
It's not so bad. Everyone's okay.

244
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,425
You've gotta watch out for the stealing.

245
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,637
So, what's your name? Your last name.

246
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,639
Everyone uses last names here.

247
00:17:48,764 --> 00:17:51,434
I'm Morello and that is Watson.

248
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,852
Chapman.

249
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:55,854
And how much time you got, Chapman?

250
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,274
Fifteen months.

251
00:17:58,357 --> 01:17:01,068
Oh, that's not so bad. I got 34,

252
01:17:01,152 --> 00:18:03,487
but I'm hoping with
good time it'll be less.

253
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,866
You... so you're a... they let you drive?

254
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:09,952
Well, who else is gonna do it?

255
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,330
We do everything around here.

256
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:17,001
Hey, can I ask you something?
You look like you'd know.

257
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,710
All right, which dress you like better?

258
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,129
My top two faves are the ones

259
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,506
with the half-and-half
lids stuck to the pages.

260
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:26,135
See, I want something that's
gonna express my personality.

261
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:29,596
And the trick is, I wanna
show off the boobs and the ass,

262
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,433
but I'm not so happy with the
upper arms and the stomach,

263
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:34,352
so there's the challenge.

264
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,481
Both nice.

265
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:40,774
That's all you gotta say?

266
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:46,697
I gotta look good. My first
dance is gonna go on YouTube.

267
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:49,825
Look! I found a rock that looks
like a penis with one ball.

268
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,119
- No.
- It's my Lance Armstrong rock.

269
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:55,956
Hold it up. Let me see, let me see. Nice.

270
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,791
Okay, now lick it, softly and tenderly,

271
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,251
like you would've when
you thought he was clean.

272
00:18:59,377 --> 01:18:00,711
Oh, Jesus! Shut that thing off.

273
01:18:00,794 --> 00:19:02,880
You're making a huge
mistake. This could go viral.

274
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:04,089
Seriously, shut it off.

275
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:06,050
- What?
- I'm so fat from all the stress-eating.

276
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:08,719
I really don't want a record of it.

277
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:12,890
You know, that's one thing
I'm gonna do in prison.

278
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,142
I'm gonna get ripped.

279
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,895
Like Jackie Warner ripped.

280
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:21,565
And I'm gonna read everything
on my Amazon wish list.

281
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,986
And maybe even learn a craft,
you know? I could be crafty.

282
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,696
I'm gonna make it count, Larry.

283
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:31,158
I'm not gonna throw away a year of my life.

284
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:32,701
What the hell are you looking for?

285
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,251
Oh, no!

286
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:41,419
What is that?

287
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:43,087
Piper...

288
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,963
Oh, Jesus, Larry. Why would you want...

289
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,843
Why would I want a felonious,
former lesbian, WASP-shiksa

290
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,429
who's about to go to prison, to marry me?

291
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:53,597
Yes. And all of the stress-eating?

292
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:58,394
Well, because this peculiar,

293
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:03,357
underachieving, underemployed
Jew-boy loves her.

294
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:08,612
And knows that he will never be bored,

295
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:14,952
and can't believe how
lucky he is that he met her.

296
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,958
I gotta lock this shit down
before you leave, Pipes.

297
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,170
I love you.

298
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,881
You wanna marry me?

299
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,008
When I get out, right?

300
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:31,802
Whenever you want.

301
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:34,054
I'll be so ripped.

302
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,144
You could wear a wedding dress
that's like a half-shirt, you know?

303
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:41,895
Show off those abs.

304
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,481
Yeah!

305
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:50,946
Was it your grandmother's?

306
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:53,657
No, my mom's saving that one for my sister.

307
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:56,201
This is my great-aunt Marcia's.

308
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:57,786
She had thyroid cancer

309
00:20:57,869 --> 01:20:01,039
and a series of schnauzers, all
named Schnapps. That's all I know.

310
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,710
Put it on. I had it sized. Good.

311
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,259
It's beautiful.

312
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,011
And that's a "yes," right?

313
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:15,346
Yes.

314
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:16,972
Yeah.

315
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:20,225
Will you say that just
one more time for me?

316
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:23,270
But, this time, just into the camera, okay?

317
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:25,814
Oh, you asshole!

318
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:27,774
- Come on, I had to capture the moment.
- Shit. Turn it off!

319
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:29,652
- What?
- Give me that!

320
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:34,406
Oh, you're cold. Come here.

321
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:36,534
Bounce your legs up and
down. It keeps your feet warm.

322
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:37,826
Thanks.

323
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,664
You think your man is still
gonna be around when you're out?

324
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:44,166
Yeah, he'll be there.
I'm the love of his life.

325
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,919
Thirty-four months is a long time.

326
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,714
Yeah, but she's the love of his life!

327
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,842
And who the fuck asked you?

328
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,052
Head on up.

329
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,679
All the gates open to one and two.

330
00:21:56,761 --> 01:21:00,057
All right, so his tie is gonna
match the bridesmaids' dresses.

331
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,475
There's six bridesmaids.

332
01:21:01,559 --> 00:22:03,602
My cousin's being a bitch, so
I'm thinking about dropping her.

333
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,405
All right, let's go.

334
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:40,556
Hello, Miss Claudette.

335
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,140
Morello.

336
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:46,395
Watch out for that one.

337
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:48,606
Don't get me wrong, she's a good lady,

338
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:50,274
but you don't wanna get on her bad side.

339
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,693
Go ahead. Go.

340
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:58,323
Okay, I'm gonna send you
all through to processing,

341
00:22:58,449 --> 00:22:59,782
you'll get your room assignments,

342
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:02,994
and I'll meet you back here
and show you your bunks. Okay?

343
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,539
Don't look so bummed.
Gonna get the wrinkles.

344
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:08,459
All right, raise your
head and look at the lens.

345
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,503
Oh, crap!

346
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:14,590
New guy, what's your name, Bennett?

347
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,635
Bennett, it's not fucking working again.

348
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,053
- You turn it on?
- Yeah, I turned it on.

349
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,352
Wait, I think I got it. Ready?

350
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:28,811
Yeah. Yep.

351
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:32,023
Wait, no.

352
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,067
- What does this button do?
- No! Don't touch that.

353
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:36,403
Sorry, princess.

354
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,530
There's a cord right there.

355
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:41,408
Do you think that that needs
to be connected to something?

356
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:44,328
Shut your mouth and stand still.

357
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:50,459
- She's right.
- Okay, fine.

358
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,669
Got it.

359
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:52,919
I wasn't ready.

360
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:54,963
Tough shit. Next.

361
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:58,841
This is a TB test. Nice veins.

362
00:23:58,925 --> 01:23:00,761
- No track marks.
- Thanks.

363
01:23:00,843 --> 00:24:02,554
Tattoos?

364
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,930
Oh, yeah.

365
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:07,518
Oh, a fish. You like fish?

366
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:12,690
Saw it on a scuba diving trip.

367
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:14,065
Thought it was beautiful.

368
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:19,279
I don't like fish. I like pork,
chicken. But it's a pretty fish.

369
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:21,990
Thanks.

370
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:23,534
It's gonna rub off when I sweat.

371
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:26,704
No, it won't. It's waterproof. Stop.

372
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:32,543
So, when this dries,
you should be good to go.

373
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:35,587
How am I gonna get it off?

374
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:36,839
Acetone.

375
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:41,009
Great. Alex, I don't,
I don't know if I can...

376
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:42,553
Hey.

377
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:44,095
Hey, hey, hey.

378
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,605
You are a nice blonde lady, aren't you?

379
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,026
A proper young lady.

380
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:02,656
Just picking up her sensible
bag in the baggage claim

381
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:06,744
before heading off to her mid-range
hotel to go over her schedules.

382
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:09,204
Museum visits and fancy dinners.

383
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,006
It's all fine. It's all good.

384
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:22,467
And I will meet you in Brussels,

385
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:24,845
and everything will
work out perfectly, babe.

386
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:26,263
I promise.

387
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,267
It's all gonna be okay.

388
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:32,728
Are you okay?

389
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:36,064
Fine. I guess.

390
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,611
What's PoPi?

391
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:41,944
Poppy.

392
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:47,158
It's a bath products line I'd
started with my friend, Polly.

393
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:51,496
Polly and Piper. PoPi.
We're gonna be in Barneys.

394
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:53,164
Barneys?

395
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,417
It's a nice store.

396
00:25:57,544 --> 01:25:01,131
It's a pretty big case.
Criminal conspiracy.

397
01:25:01,256 --> 00:26:03,801
That's what they charged me with.

398
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:06,428
I carried a suitcase of money.

399
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:09,180
Drug money. Once.

400
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,475
Ten years ago.

401
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,226
What's the statute of limitations on that?

402
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,480
Twelve years.

403
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:18,816
That's tough.

404
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:20,108
Well,

405
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:27,574
I did it, that one time, 10 years ago.

406
00:26:27,908 --> 00:26:29,075
What did your lawyer say?

407
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,620
He said with the mandatory
minimums with drug crimes,

408
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:34,456
he wouldn't recommend risking
a trial. So, I pleaded out.

409
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:35,833
And here you are.

410
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,584
Here I am.

411
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,339
Costing the tax payers money
and sweating in my armchair.

412
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,258
You know, I've been here for 22 years,

413
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:48,679
and I still can't figure
out how the system works.

414
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:51,682
I got a crack dealer
who is doing nine months,

415
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:56,561
and then I have a lady who
accidently backed into a mailman

416
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:58,689
who is doing four years.

417
00:26:58,772 --> 01:26:01,023
I mean, the guy broke his
collar bone, but come on.

418
01:26:01,107 --> 00:27:02,901
I just don't get it.

419
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,405
Are you gonna barf?

420
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:08,573
Tell me if you're gonna barf.

421
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:10,032
Because there's a can behind you.

422
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:11,785
I won't barf.

423
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,872
I will be truly displeased if
you barf anywhere but in that can.

424
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:17,207
Not gonna barf.

425
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,836
Miss Chapman,

426
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:26,299
no one's gonna mess with
you here unless you let them.

427
00:27:27,342 --> 00:27:29,093
This isn't Oz.

428
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:31,596
Women fight with gossip and rumors.

429
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:36,894
They might peg you for rich and
try to hit you up for commissary.

430
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:39,855
And there are lesbians.

431
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,816
They're not gonna bother you.

432
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,902
They'll try to be your friend,

433
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:46,403
just stay away from them.

434
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,869
I want you to understand, you
do not have to have lesbian sex.

435
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,668
I have a fiancé.

436
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:04,421
His name is Larry.

437
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:06,048
He's a writer.

438
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:09,133
Can he come visit me?

439
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,469
- Is he in here?
- Yes. Everybody's in there.

440
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:14,681
All the people in the
PSI are cleared to visit.

441
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:16,016
He can come this weekend.

442
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:18,685
I'll make sure the list
is in the visiting room.

443
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,520
Thank you so much, Mr. Healy.

444
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:25,567
You just keep to yourself.
And you'll be fine.

445
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,027
And don't make friends.

446
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:33,617
And remember, nothing goes on
here that I don't know about.

447
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:37,119
You know everything about
me! I tell you everything!

448
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:40,624
The webcam horror, the
penis shaving incident.

449
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:42,042
How do I not know this?

450
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,544
What was I supposed to say? It was...

451
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:46,546
It was a phase.

452
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,175
It was my lost-soul,
post-college adventure phase.

453
00:28:52,928 --> 00:28:57,140
I was so embarrassed. I can't
believe that she did this.

454
00:28:57,265 --> 00:28:58,976
I can't believe you did this.

455
00:28:59,768 --> 01:28:00,978
I mean, who are you?

456
01:28:01,103 --> 00:29:04,314
I feel like I'm in a Bourne
movie. Have you killed?

457
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,820
Oh, Jesus. Oh, no. Baby. Stop. Stop, stop.

458
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:11,279
Come on. Come on.

459
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:14,116
Okay.

460
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:15,867
You should break up with me.

461
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:18,369
- What?
- You didn't sign up for this.

462
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:22,248
Okay, stop it. Stop it.
Come on. Shh. It's okay.

463
00:29:22,624 --> 00:29:24,042
Okay?

464
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,335
Okay?

465
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:31,174
"Witness states, Piper
Chapman carried drug money.

466
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:33,343
"Piper Chapman was part of the ring."

467
00:29:33,468 --> 00:29:34,678
Were you?

468
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:37,388
I was 22.

469
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:40,684
I thought that I was in love.

470
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:43,061
I was in love.

471
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:45,355
And it was all crazy.

472
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:49,734
And then it got scary,

473
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,319
and I ran away,

474
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:55,198
and I became the nice blonde
lady that I was supposed to be.

475
00:29:55,365 --> 01:29:00,495
I knew that she wasn't a
good person, but fuck her!

476
01:29:02,246 --> 00:30:05,917
Fuck her! This is not gonna be okay.

477
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:08,753
- No.
- No.

478
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,213
It's not.

479
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:18,889
But we'll deal with it, okay?

480
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:23,309
We'll figure it out.

481
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,395
Have you called a lawyer?

482
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,231
- No.
- I'll call my dad.

483
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,775
No! No. Please don't call
your dad. He already hates me.

484
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:34,112
Yeah, well, I love you.

485
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:40,035
And, and he loves me, so, here we go.

486
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:42,704
All right, we gotta hustle,
'cause the count's soon.

487
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:45,207
Uh, rooms are there. Dorms are down there.

488
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:47,250
Now, you are not allowed down there.

489
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,419
It's out of bounds for you guys
until you get assigned there.

490
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:51,129
You understand?

491
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,797
Namaste, Jones!

492
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:53,924
Namaste!

493
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,800
She teaches yoga if you ever want.

494
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:58,011
And she's good. She's very spiritual.

495
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:59,930
All right, we got some offices here.

496
01:30:00,013 --> 00:31:03,100
This is the dining hall,
common room, counselor's office.

497
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:04,726
Who you got for a counselor?

498
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:06,144
Uh, Healy.

499
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:07,437
Okay. Yeah.

500
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:08,605
What?

501
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:11,399
Nah, it's fine. It's fine. He does
his paperwork. That's a good thing.

502
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,569
When do we get outfits like everybody?

503
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:17,114
I don't know. Maybe
tomorrow after breakfast.

504
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,449
You go down, you speak to the lady...

505
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:22,577
What the fuck?

506
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:24,871
Friend of yours?

507
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:28,416
No. It's my mom.

508
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:33,004
All right, Chapman, Diaz, this is you.

509
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,339
DeMarco, this is Chapman. She's new.

510
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:36,883
Self-surrender. You show her what's what?

511
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,176
Sure.

512
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:41,387
Okay, Mendoza, this is Diaz.
Go, go. She'll help you.

513
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,059
Um, I don't speak Spanish.

514
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,853
Great. Another fucking coconut.

515
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:51,106
What's the matter with your
mother, she don't teach you Spanish?

516
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:57,988
Here. Here's some tissues.
First night's always hard.

517
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:02,325
And a toothbrush. They don't give you one.

518
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,536
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you for everything.

519
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:08,331
No, no. It's no problem.
We look out for our own.

520
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,875
Our own?

521
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:15,088
Oh, don't get all PC on me. It's
tribal, not racist. I'll see you around.

522
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,013
Tell me your name again?

523
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:26,099
Piper. Chapman.

524
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,725
That's Miss Rosa.

525
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:32,396
And that's Nichols. Just
got out of SHU a week ago.

526
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:35,942
Told a CO to kiss her ass. Dumb.

527
00:32:36,026 --> 00:32:37,986
Why make trouble for yourself, you know?

528
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:39,821
SHU. That's solitary?

529
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:42,991
Yep. And you don't want
it, honey. Trust me.

530
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,910
Here's some toilet paper.
You gotta take it with you.

531
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,080
Thanks. What's that thing?

532
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,377
Oh, that's my machine. I need it at night.

533
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:56,420
When I first got here, I
had a massive heart attack.

534
00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,216
Do you know about the count?

535
00:32:59,299 --> 01:32:00,967
Wait, can you go back to the heart attack?

536
01:32:01,051 --> 01:32:02,219
I don't like to dwell.

537
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:04,387
How do I make a phone call?

538
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,683
You need a PAC number. Fill
out a form. Whole rigmarole.

539
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:11,435
But maybe Caputo will
let you make a call later.

540
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:13,521
It helps if you cry.

541
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,276
Don't make your bed!

542
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:19,402
What?

543
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:20,904
We'll make it for you.

544
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:22,572
Oh, no, that's okay. You
don't need to do that.

545
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,781
Honey!

546
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:28,078
We'll make the bed.

547
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:29,162
We know how.

548
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:31,289
I know how to make a bed.

549
00:33:31,414 --> 00:33:33,666
We know how to do it so
we'll pass inspection.

550
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,837
You can help clean. We clean
everything with Maxi Pads.

551
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:39,422
Seriously?

552
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:42,050
Yep. It's a head-scratcher,
but that's what we got.

553
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,761
So, we make our beds in
the morning before they...

554
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:48,639
No. You sleep on top of the
bed. With a blanket over you.

555
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:50,767
What if I want to sleep in the bed?

556
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:53,061
Look, you can do what you want,

557
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:56,273
but you will be the only one
in this entire prison that does.

558
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,150
You want that? Be my guest.

559
00:33:59,276 --> 01:33:02,195
Count time! Count time! Count time, ladies!

560
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:05,448
That light comes on, you need to
be where you're supposed to be,

561
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:09,119
and you don't move until
it goes off. Dinner's after.

562
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:12,289
Hey, blanca. You speak Spanish?

563
00:34:13,123 --> 00:34:16,000
Un poco. Entiendo mas
de lo que puedo hablar.

564
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:19,963
You see, fucking white girl speaks Spanish.

565
00:34:34,894 --> 00:34:35,937
So?

566
00:34:36,146 --> 00:34:37,397
Shh. Wait.

567
00:34:48,992 --> 00:34:50,243
Dinner's at 4:30?

568
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:52,203
Recount, ladies!

569
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:55,457
They always screw it up.

570
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,459
How hard is it to fucking count?

571
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,461
Nicky, this is uh...

572
00:34:59,585 --> 01:34:01,004
Piper. Uh, Chapman.

573
01:34:02,130 --> 00:35:04,007
Look at you, blondie. What'd you do?

574
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,759
Aren't you not supposed
to ask that question?

575
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,511
I read that you're not
supposed to ask that.

576
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:10,763
You read that?

577
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,142
What, you studied for prison?

578
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:24,194
What did you do?

579
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:25,903
I can't understand your French.

580
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:28,865
Mon bag! Bag!

581
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:30,367
My bag hasn't arrived.

582
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:33,370
Oh! The bags do not make it
onto the right flight sometime.

583
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:35,413
Wait for the next shuttle from Paris.

584
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:37,332
It's probably on that plane.

585
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:05,235
Mon bag!

586
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:06,403
My bag.

587
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,085
- Bonjour.
- Oh! Bonjour.

588
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:26,089
Welcome to Belgium. All good?

589
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:29,592
I was starting to worry.
Where did you come from?

590
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:30,718
Over there.

591
00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:33,012
You didn't go through customs?

592
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:35,515
No, I just walked out of that
door and it brought me right here.

593
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:39,685
You skipped customs?
Holy shit! It's genius.

594
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,397
- Well, should I go back?
- Fuck, no. We're going to the hotel.

595
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,690
I'm gonna eat you for dinner.

596
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:48,778
Alex, I was so freaked out when the
bag didn't show up, I almost bailed.

597
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:50,488
Well, it's good thing you didn't.

598
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:51,906
There's over 50 grand in that bag.

599
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:54,325
Kubra would have had you killed. Come on.

600
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:57,954
Keep moving. You're blocking up the works.

601
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:09,382
Okay, go sit there.
She's a nice white lady.

602
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,176
Thanks.

603
00:37:22,812 --> 00:37:23,980
Hi.

604
00:37:25,648 --> 00:37:26,816
It's okay if I sit here?

605
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:28,651
Sure, newbie.

606
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:31,737
I'm Jones.

607
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:33,573
Chapman.

608
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:36,242
You doing okay, Chapman?

609
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,329
I don't really know how
to answer that question.

610
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:43,082
Everything's pretty surreal right now.

611
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:48,212
Do you know what a mandala is?

612
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:49,755
Um...

613
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,175
Those are those round Buddhist art things.

614
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:56,179
The Tibetan monks make
them out of dyed sand

615
00:37:56,304 --> 00:37:59,807
laid out into big, beautiful designs.

616
01:37:00,183 --> 00:38:03,853
And when they're done,
after days or weeks of work,

617
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:06,022
they wipe it all away.

618
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:10,527
Wow. That's a lot.

619
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:14,947
Try to look at your experience
here as a mandala, Chapman.

620
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:21,204
Work hard to make something as
meaningful and beautiful as you can.

621
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:24,999
And when you're done, pack it
in and know it was all temporary.

622
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,962
You have to remember
that. It's all temporary.

623
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:33,174
It's all temporary.

624
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:39,763
I'm telling you. Surviving
here is all about perspective.

625
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:44,060
Don't eat the pudding.

626
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:46,187
What's the perspective on the pudding?

627
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,439
It comes in big cans marked "Desert Storm."

628
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:53,570
Sometimes the kitchen has to scrape the
mold off the top before they serve it.

629
00:38:54,111 --> 00:38:55,363
Hi, there.

630
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,824
Hi, Sister. This is Chapman.

631
00:38:59,450 --> 01:38:00,618
Sister? As in nun?

632
01:38:00,826 --> 00:39:03,204
Yep. A killer nun.

633
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:06,040
Now, stop it. She doesn't
know you're joking.

634
00:39:06,123 --> 00:39:09,877
She chained herself to a
flagpole at a nuclear test site.

635
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:15,592
Amen.

636
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:19,220
So. Now, Chapman, what's your story?

637
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,056
I chained myself to a drug dealer.

638
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:27,604
Piper, you can't be taking
advice from a nun and a hippie.

639
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:32,275
By all means, seek out the supreme
wisdom of the junkie philosopher.

640
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:33,943
I pray for you, Nicky.

641
00:39:34,193 --> 00:39:37,238
Aw. I pray for you, too, Sister.

642
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:40,824
I lust after you, Yoga
Jones, those sinewy arms.

643
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,620
You gotta love a yoga body.

644
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:46,289
You should come to class.
Watch me chaturanga.

645
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:48,499
That whole common room smells like farts.

646
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,126
It kind of takes away the magic for me.

647
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:51,711
You like pussy, Piper?

648
00:39:52,169 --> 00:39:54,464
Or you prefer pipe as your name suggests?

649
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:56,799
I'm feeling some Sapphic
vibes coming off you.

650
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:58,342
Oh, leave her alone.

651
00:39:59,885 --> 01:39:00,970
Come on, Sister.

652
01:39:01,095 --> 00:40:03,139
You know you would've gone my
way if you hadn't married Jesus.

653
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,606
Thank you, Mommy.

654
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:15,025
Thanks, Red.

655
00:40:18,237 --> 00:40:19,322
Thanks, Red.

656
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:23,867
She's your mom?

657
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:25,411
Maternal figurehead.

658
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:28,247
My actual mother lives in
Brazil with her boyfriend, Paolo,

659
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:30,958
who destroys rainforests and
collects photorealistic art.

660
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:33,002
She is a cunt. I am an embarrassment.

661
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:35,713
Hey, Red. You got one of those for me?

662
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,174
You got what I asked you for?

663
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:40,259
Uh, I'm working on it.

664
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,348
So am I. Treats come when I sleep better.

665
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:53,314
How hard is it to get me
a board from the woodshop?

666
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:54,940
People.

667
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,319
Who's this?

668
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:02,824
This is Chapman. She's new.
Self-surrender. Thinks she's fancy.

669
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,204
Here, fancy. Have a yogurt.

670
00:41:11,957 --> 00:41:13,543
What do I have to do for it?

671
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:18,381
You're new. You're one
of us. Consider it a gift.

672
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:23,344
Thank you. Thank you so much.

673
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:29,225
The food here is disgusting.

674
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:40,110
What?

675
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,321
Did I mention that Red runs the kitchen?

676
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:48,494
Shit. I'm sorry.

677
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,876
Honey.

678
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:58,254
I know you just got here, so
you don't know what's what.

679
00:41:58,546 --> 01:41:00,130
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

680
01:41:00,256 --> 00:42:05,052
You don't like the food? It's no problem.

681
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:16,564
Holy shit. That was an epic fuck-up.

682
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:20,359
Can I help you?

683
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:24,447
Um, I'm Chapman. I'm new today.

684
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:28,075
They told me I should talk to
you. I don't have a PAC number.

685
00:42:28,242 --> 00:42:29,410
Who's they?

686
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:36,500
Mr. Caputo, please let me call my fiancé.

687
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:38,377
I have to let him know I'm okay.

688
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:42,924
Two minutes. You got
two minutes, that's it.

689
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:45,092
Close the door, I don't
want a run on my office.

690
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:47,637
Inmate Gonzalez report to the supply room.

691
00:42:53,643 --> 00:42:55,352
Dial nine to get out.

692
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:07,490
- Hello, Larry's phone.
- Amy?

693
00:43:07,615 --> 00:43:09,241
- Piper?
- Give me the phone.

694
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:11,118
One second. Can I say hello?

695
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:13,496
Amy, I only have two minutes to talk.

696
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:16,332
Are you okay? What's it like in there?

697
00:43:16,415 --> 00:43:19,710
Howard and I brought
Chinese. Larry is so upset.

698
00:43:19,836 --> 00:43:20,837
- Mom.
- Let him talk, Amy.

699
00:43:20,962 --> 00:43:21,963
Ma, give me the phone.

700
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:23,589
Amy, please let me talk to Larry.

701
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:26,634
You know, I read that when
Martha Stewart was in prison,

702
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:28,135
she foraged for dandelions.

703
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:29,720
Okay, Mom, please.

704
00:43:29,846 --> 00:43:32,598
- I was talking!
- Amy, it's not always about you, dear.

705
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,517
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Piper?

706
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,644
I only have a minute now. I'm
calling from the guard's office.

707
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:38,479
Hey, are you okay? What's going on?

708
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:39,856
I love you so much.

709
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:41,816
I love you, too. Are you okay?

710
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:44,527
I'm wearing granny panties and
I've only spoken to white people.

711
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:46,904
You joining the Aryan Nation?

712
00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:48,865
I don't know. But there's a nun here.

713
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:51,200
And you're not allowed to sleep
in your bed. Only on top of it.

714
00:43:51,283 --> 00:43:52,326
That's weird.

715
00:43:52,451 --> 00:43:53,494
I know, right?

716
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:54,620
And when I got here, they gave me these

717
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:56,998
little bars of hotel soap, but no shampoo.

718
00:43:57,373 --> 01:43:01,084
But I think that I can borrow
some from other white people.

719
01:43:02,211 --> 00:44:03,754
I love you so much.

720
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,842
One of my roommates had a massive
heart attack when she got here.

721
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:10,219
Okay, you are not allowed
to have a heart attack.

722
00:44:11,428 --> 00:44:12,596
What did you have for dinner?

723
00:44:13,472 --> 00:44:15,516
My folks brought from The Palace.

724
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:17,935
Oh. The Palace.

725
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:20,563
Dinner here was scary liver.

726
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:23,607
And I insulted the chef,

727
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:26,109
and you're not supposed to eat the pudding

728
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:27,611
because it's been to Desert Storm.

729
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:30,573
Piper, listen to me. You
cannot lose your shit, okay?

730
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:33,034
I mean it. Please, please tell
me you're keeping it together.

731
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:35,995
Please, please tell me you're okay.

732
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:39,040
- Wrap it up, Chapman.
- I'm Chapman here.

733
00:44:39,248 --> 00:44:45,087
You're my Pipes, okay? And, uh, I
love you, and this is only temporary.

734
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:49,091
That's what Yoga Jones said.
But it's just been one day.

735
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:50,634
And I can't, I can't!

736
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,929
Piper, you can. You so can, okay?

737
00:44:53,054 --> 00:44:55,932
You are so strong, babe. You...

738
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:57,349
And you love adventure, right?

739
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,727
That's what got you in there, and
that's what's gonna get you through.

740
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:03,731
This is all just a big adventure
with liver and Yoga Jones,

741
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:05,608
and racism.

742
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:08,027
You can come on Friday.
Please come on Friday.

743
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:09,361
Tell my mother to come on Saturday,

744
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:11,238
and don't tell her that
you're coming on Friday, okay?

745
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,114
Of course. Okay?

746
00:45:13,198 --> 00:45:15,158
Two sleeps. That's it.

747
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:17,536
Two sleeps on top of your bed.

748
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,955
And then, I will be there.

749
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:22,291
Coming up on lights out. Say goodbye.

750
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:24,125
I have to go.

751
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:25,377
Hey, no crying.

752
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:26,670
I'm not crying.

753
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:29,006
Piper, I love you. I
will see you on Friday.

754
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,133
Please, be brave. Don't let
anyone into your granny panties.

755
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:33,343
I love you.

756
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:34,762
I love you.

757
00:45:39,558 --> 00:45:42,561
Your head's not here yet.
Don't worry, it'll catch up.

758
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:46,565
In the meantime, try to get some sleep.

759
00:45:46,649 --> 00:45:49,735
Orientation is tomorrow at 9:00.

760
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,570
Shampoo for you.

761
00:45:53,948 --> 00:45:56,157
I think the words you're
looking for are, "Thank you."

762
00:45:56,826 --> 00:45:58,159
Thank you.

763
00:45:58,995 --> 01:45:00,203
Good night, Chapman.

764
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,167
Close the door behind you.

765
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:27,439
Chapman. Hey, Chapman.

766
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:28,524
- What?
- Rise and shine.

767
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:29,775
What? What?

768
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:32,611
You want time to shower
and eat, you gotta get up.

769
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:34,738
Aw, look at your eyes.

770
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:36,239
You should put some cold water on them.

771
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:37,658
Okay. Thanks.

772
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:39,368
Take a nice shower, get dressed,

773
00:46:39,493 --> 00:46:41,704
you'll start to feel normal soon enough.

774
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,998
- You got
flip-flops? - No.

775
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,960
Oh, honey. There's wicked
fungus in the showers.

776
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:07,897
You're driving me crazy!

777
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:42,056
Everyone gets a piece
of fruit at breakfast.

778
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:45,350
I'm telling you, it'll all start
to feel normal, soon. Really.

779
00:47:45,935 --> 00:47:48,562
- You hungry?
- I'm starving. Excuse me.

780
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:50,271
- Such pretty hair.
- Thank you.

781
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,523
When those roots start to show,

782
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:52,942
be sure to come and see me, okay?

783
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:54,777
I'll take good care of you.

784
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:57,738
But even if you don't come
to me, don't go to Danita.

785
00:47:57,821 --> 01:47:01,324
She'll burn the shit out of
your scalp. Go. Line's moving.

786
00:48:02,451 --> 00:48:03,744
Wait, Chapman? Are you Chapman?

787
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:04,954
Yes.

788
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:10,834
Red says she made that special for you.

789
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,963
Wow. Thanks. Tell her I said thanks.

790
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,048
I don't say nothing.
I'm just working. Next.

791
00:48:17,925 --> 00:48:18,968
Man, I'm telling you,

792
00:48:19,093 --> 00:48:21,971
before my teeth got knocked
out, I had this awesome gap.

793
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:23,889
Now they look like Chiclets, look.

794
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:25,933
You're crazy. Your fake
teeth are beautiful.

795
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:27,726
Bet you never get the food stuck in them.

796
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,519
So, you got the nice
fresh breath all the time.

797
00:48:29,645 --> 00:48:30,604
It's minty. It's beautiful.

798
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:32,648
It's like God put them in you every day.

799
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:34,150
A summer breeze coming over here.

800
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:36,819
- Yeah? You like that?
- Always smell... Yeah. Yeah.

801
00:48:39,696 --> 00:48:40,948
What did you do?

802
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:42,532
She insulted the food in front of Red.

803
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:44,994
Oh, jeez. I don't think you're
gonna be eating for a while.

804
00:48:46,162 --> 00:48:50,082
Oh! Put it away. I'm enjoying
menopause very much, thank you.

805
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:53,669
You gotta figure out how to
make things right with Red.

806
00:48:53,836 --> 00:48:55,712
And yeah, yeah. You
gotta go down to laundry.

807
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,339
Don't forget that. And check
the elastic on all the pants.

808
00:48:58,465 --> 01:48:00,217
Don't let them get you
stretched-out garbage.

809
01:48:00,341 --> 00:49:02,469
Orientation starts in 10 minutes.

810
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:04,847
At least you had a nice
shower this morning, right?

811
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,182
I think I saw you in there?

812
00:49:10,351 --> 00:49:14,023
I don't... I don't know. Excuse me.

813
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,357
Hey! Hey, hey, don't forget,
you gotta bus your tray.

814
00:49:23,032 --> 00:49:24,908
Where's she going with that tray?

815
00:49:25,034 --> 00:49:26,076
Can't take them out of here.

816
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:27,368
Yeah, she'll figure it out.

817
00:49:27,577 --> 00:49:29,205
Was she really in the shower this morning?

818
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,728
Maybe this is a bad time to say hi, huh?
